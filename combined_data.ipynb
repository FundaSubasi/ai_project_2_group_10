    "It is accepted as general knowledge that when economic times are harder, the entertainment industry tends to do well. Assuming this is true, there should be a strong correlation between any given movie's critical and financial successes and indicators of the economic climate at that movie's release date. By examining both movie data and economic indicators from 1981 to 2023 these relationships will be shown through features such as a given movie's ratings, return on investment, and economic features such as consumer spending habits and employment rates."
