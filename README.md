## Data

### Datasets

We reviewed datasets that provided the most opportunity for a thorough exploration of our key questions:

**Movies**
* Movies Dataset:

## Project Management
|  Phases | Details|
| :--- | :--- |
| Data Fetching  | Google searches, Kaggle, EPI Data Library, Census API search    |
| Software Version Control | Repository created on GitHub, GitHub Projects used to create and track tasks based on key questions, Git branch used to upload files to from local computer to remote repository, utilized "compare & pull requests" to compare branch changes before merging into the main branch correlation, comparison, summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and time series analysis   |
| EDA | Imported CSV files, created dataframes, utlized pandas and python functions to search, select and handle missing data movies and economoic dataset, identified keys features , experience levels, skills, and employment trends for further analysis    |
| Preprocessing  |  Utilized dictionarys, list, loops, column slicing, string manipulation, and train-test split to prevent data leakage and ensure high quality and structured data is visualized and fed into the models for linear regression predictions and classification   |
| Modeling & Tuning |  Utilized dictionarys, list, loops, column slicing, string manipulation, to ensure high quality and structured data is visualized and fed into the models for linear regression predictions and classification   |
